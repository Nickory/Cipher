# Cipher - Application Cryptography Experiments

This repository contains a collection of six experiments required for the Application Cryptography course at Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (NUIST). Each experiment is organized with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make the understanding and usage more intuitive. The experiments cover fundamental cryptographic concepts, and this project serves as a convenient tool for learning and improving cryptographic techniques.

## Features
- **GUI for each experiment**: Each cryptography experiment has been designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing for a more hands-on and visual experience.
- **Comprehensive collection**: The repository includes all six experiments from the course, providing a complete set of tools for learning application cryptography.
- **Easy to use**: Simply run the provided scripts to interact with each cryptographic algorithm or experiment.
