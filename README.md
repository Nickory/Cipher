# Cipher - Application Cryptography Experiments
# 密码实验 - 应用密码学课程实验

This repository contains a collection of six experiments required for the Application Cryptography course at Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (NUIST). Each experiment is organized with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make the understanding and usage more intuitive. The experiments cover fundamental cryptographic concepts, and this project serves as a convenient tool for learning and improving cryptographic techniques.

本项目包含南京信息工程大学应用密码学课程所需的六个实验。每个实验都配备了图形用户界面 (GUI)，以使其理解和使用更加直观。这些实验涵盖了密码学的基本概念，是学习和改进密码学技术的便捷工具。
